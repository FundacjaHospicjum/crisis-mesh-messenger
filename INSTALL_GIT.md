.\PUSH_TO_GITHUB.ps1
```

Or follow manual steps in QUICK_START_GITHUB.md

## Troubleshooting

### "git is not recognized"
- **Solution**: Restart PowerShell after installation
- If still not working, restart your computer

### "Cannot run script"
```powershell
# Enable script execution
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
# Then run the script again
```

### Installation Hangs
- Close installer
- Disable antivirus temporarily
- Run installer as Administrator (right-click â†’ Run as administrator)

## Alternative: GitHub Desktop

If you prefer a GUI:
1. Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Install and sign in with GitHub account
3. Clone the repository
4. Commit and push through the app

But command line (Git) is recommended for this project.
