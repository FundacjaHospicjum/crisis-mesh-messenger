## ⚡ Major New Features

### 1. **SOS Emergency System** 🔴

**One tap could save a life.**

#### What It Does:
- **Instant distress signals** broadcast to all nearby devices
- **10 emergency types**: SOS, Medical, Trapped, Danger, Need Water, Food, Medication, Shelter, Safe Check-in, Survivor Found
- **Smart priority routing**: Critical signals get broadcast first

#### How It Works:
1. Open app → Tap giant red SOS banner
2. Select emergency type
3. One tap → Signal broadcasting instantly
4. Signal propagates through ALL nearby devices
5. Help arrives faster

#### Technical Innovation:
- **Priority scoring algorithm**: Critical signals =  top priority
