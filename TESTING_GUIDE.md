2. **Add to PATH:**
   ```powershell
   # Open PowerShell as Administrator
   $env:Path += ";C:\src\flutter\bin"
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path, "Machine")
   ```

3. **Verify Installation:**
   ```powershell
   flutter doctor
   ```

4. **Accept Android Licenses:**
   ```powershell
   flutter doctor --android-licenses
   ```

### Option 2: Chocolatey

```powershell

## After Flutter Installation

### 1. Get Dependencies

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Hipek\OneDrive\Pulpit\New Network\CascadeProjects\windsurf-project\crisis_mesh"
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Check Setup

```powershell
flutter doctor -v
```

**You should see:**
- ‚úÖ Flutter SDK
- ‚úÖ Android toolchain (optional for now)
- ‚úÖ VS Code or Android Studio (optional)

### 3. Run on Windows Desktop (Easiest)

```powershell
# Enable Windows desktop support
flutter config --enable-windows-desktop

# Run the app
flutter run -d windows
```

### 4. Run on Android Emulator

```powershell
# List available devices
flutter devices

# Start emulator (if you have Android Studio)
# Or connect physical device via USB

# Run app
flutter run
```

## What You'll See

When the app runs, you'll see:

### Home Screen
- "Crisis Mesh" title
- Network status banner showing "No devices found"
- Empty conversation list
- Floating "+ New Message" button

### Test the UI
1. Click "Network Status" icon ‚Üí See network details
2. Wait ~10 seconds ‚Üí Simulated peers will appear
3. Click "+ New Message" ‚Üí Select a simulated peer
4. Type and send messages ‚Üí See them in chat
5. Go back ‚Üí See conversation in list

### Screenshots for Testing

Take screenshots of:
- [ ] Home screen
- [ ] Network status
- [ ] Chat screen
- [ ] Message sending
- [ ] Simulated peers appearing

---

## Known Issues (Expected)

‚úÖ **These are NORMAL for v0.1.0:**
- "No devices found" initially (networking is simulated)
- Peers appear slowly (every 10 seconds)
- Messages don't go to other devices (not implemented yet)
- No real Bluetooth/WiFi (Phase 2)

‚ùå **These would be BUGS:**
- App crashes on startup
- Can't type messages
- UI elements overlapping
- Navigation not working

---

## Quick Verification Checklist

After running the app, verify:

- [ ] App launches without crashing
- [ ] Home screen displays correctly
- [ ] Can navigate to Network Status screen
- [ ] Can open New Message dialog
- [ ] Can select a simulated peer
- [ ] Can type in message input
- [ ] Can send message (shows in chat)
- [ ] Message appears in conversation list
- [ ] Can go back to home screen
- [ ] App responds smoothly (no freezing)

---

## Development Workflow

### Hot Reload (Fast Development)

While app is running:
```
Press 'r' ‚Üí Hot reload (instant UI updates)
Press 'R' ‚Üí Hot restart (full app restart)
Press 'q' ‚Üí Quit
```

### Making Changes

1. Edit any Dart file
2. Press `r` in terminal
3. See changes instantly!

### Example: Change Theme Color

Edit `lib/ui/theme/app_theme.dart`:
```dart
static const Color primaryColor = Color(0xFFFF5722); // Change to orange
```
Press `r` ‚Üí See new color!

## Troubleshooting

### "flutter: command not found"
- Restart PowerShell after installation
- Check PATH includes Flutter bin directory
- Run: `$env:Path` to verify

### "No devices available"
**Solution:** Run on Windows desktop first
```powershell
flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
flutter run -d windows
```

### "Unable to locate Android SDK"
**Solution:** Either:
1. Install Android Studio, OR
2. Use Windows desktop (easier)

### Build Errors
```powershell
# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Package Errors
```powershell
# Update dependencies
flutter pub upgrade
flutter pub get
```

---

## Performance Testing

Once app is running, test:

### Responsiveness
- Resize window (if Windows desktop)
- Scroll conversation list
- Send multiple messages quickly
- Switch between screens rapidly

### Memory Usage
- Open Windows Task Manager
- Find "crisis_mesh.exe"
- Memory should be < 500MB
- CPU should be low when idle

### Battery (Mobile)
- Run on physical device
- Use for 10 minutes
- Check battery drain
- Should be < 5% for 10 min idle
