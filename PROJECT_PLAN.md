## Executive Summary

**Crisis Mesh Messenger** is an open-source, infrastructure-free messaging application designed to provide communication when traditional systems fail. Using device-to-device mesh networking via Bluetooth and WiFi Direct, the app enables people to stay connected during crises, disasters, wars, and in censored or remote regions.

**Current Achievement:** v0.1.0 proof-of-concept released with complete UI, architecture, and documentation.

**Next Milestone:** Implement real Bluetooth/WiFi mesh networking for actual device-to-device communication.

**Ultimate Goal:** Deploy a production-ready app that can be used globally in crisis situations, potentially saving lives and enabling freedom of communication.

## Project Vision & Mission

### Vision
A world where communication cannot be cut off, censored, or blocked. Where people in crisis situations always have a way to reach loved ones and coordinate help.

### Mission
Build and maintain a free, open-source, infrastructure-free messaging platform that works when everything else fails.

### Core Values
1. **Humanitarian First** - Lives over profits
2. **Privacy & Security** - End-to-end encryption by default
3. **Resilience** - Works in the worst conditions
4. **Accessibility** - Simple enough for anyone to use
5. **Open Source** - Transparent and community-driven

### Target Users
- **Primary:** People in active conflict zones (e.g., Ukraine, Gaza)
- **Secondary:** Disaster-affected populations (earthquakes, hurricanes, floods)
- **Tertiary:** Protesters in censored regions, remote communities
- **Future:** General public as backup communication
